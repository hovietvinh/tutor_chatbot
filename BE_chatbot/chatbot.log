This can be helpful, like automatic behaviors, \nbut also lead to unexpected actions or emotional responses."} - Content: Culture is a set of beliefs, values, and practices that shape our minds and behaviors. It provides a 
framework for understanding the world and interpreting our experiences. This shared framework 
enables individuals to communicate with each other and to cooperate with one another. Culture plays 
a significant role in shaping the way we think and perceive the world around us.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - Content: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-15 17:43:07,373 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - Content: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - Content: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.
2025-05-15 17:43:20,721 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 2. Flexibility
Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-15 17:43:20,722 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).

feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - Content: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products.

now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available.

The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-15 17:54:24,312 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.
2025-05-15 17:54:38,065 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 3 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 2. Importance of understanding technological evolution
Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-15 17:54:38,068 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the \noptions available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so \ncomplex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant \namount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly \nremote.ï¿½'} - Content: Too many choices will increase the cognitive load for users.
Break up long or complex processes into screens with fewer options.
Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.
2025-05-20 16:58:16,996 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 3 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 2. Importance of understanding technological evolution
Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 16:58:16,998 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the \noptions available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so \ncomplex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant \namount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly \nremote.ï¿½'} - Content: Too many choices will increase the cognitive load for users.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 16:58:33,953 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize.

now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.
2025-05-20 17:23:24,065 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 3 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 2. Importance of understanding technological evolution
Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - Content: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the \noptions available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so \ncomplex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant \namount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly \nremote.ï¿½'} - Content: Too many choices will increase the cognitive load for users.
Break up long or complex processes into screens with fewer options.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.

a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products.

now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 19:17:28,422 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.
2025-05-20 19:21:10,369 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 3 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 2. Importance of understanding technological evolution
Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - Content: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.
2025-05-20 19:21:10,371 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 2. Flexibility
Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the \noptions available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so \ncomplex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant \namount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly \nremote.ï¿½'} - Content: Too many choices will increase the cognitive load for users.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example,

a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 19:21:28,504 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products.

now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 19:29:29,538 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the \noptions available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so \ncomplex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant \namount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly \nremote.ï¿½'} - Content: Too many choices will increase the cognitive load for users.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.
2025-05-20 19:32:31,277 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 3 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 2. Importance of understanding technological evolution
Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 19:32:31,280 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize.

now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available.

The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 19:32:48,045 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.
2025-05-20 19:32:48,047 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 5 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 2. Discussion about Personalized user interface
At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the \noptions available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so \ncomplex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant \namount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly \nremote.ï¿½'} - Content: Too many choices will increase the cognitive load for users.

2025-05-20 19:32:48,048 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 6 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 2. MILLERï¿½S LAW
Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 19:38:50,532 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - Content: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.
2025-05-20 19:39:06,546 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 3 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 2. Importance of understanding technological evolution
Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - Content: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 19:39:06,550 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.
2025-05-20 19:39:06,550 - INFO - Segmented subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 5 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Adaptive and Personalized interfaces', 'section': 'Adaptive interfaces', 'subsection': 'Personalized interfaces are interfaces that can be customized, allowing users some degree of \nflexibility in input/output modality, display and control. For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - Content: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 20:53:52,127 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed,

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 21:45:17,951 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Computer revolution (also known as a digital revolution) is a point in time at which computers make 
a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.
2025-05-20 21:45:41,542 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 3 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 2. Importance of understanding technological evolution
Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - Content: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 21:45:41,544 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'section': 'General Information', 'relevance_score': 0.5} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \nexperiences we interact with everyday.\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \nreaction time to any given stimulus.\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.'} - Content: Cognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. 
Our brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: 
when the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is 
incurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed 
details and even frustration.

As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the \noptions available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so \ncomplex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant \namount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly \nremote.ï¿½'} - Content: Too many choices will increase the cognitive load for users.
Break up long or complex processes into screens with fewer options.
Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users.

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - Content: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 22:06:35,070 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - Content: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - Content: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 22:07:37,795 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - Content: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 22:07:53,859 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - Content: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

This can be helpful, like automatic behaviors, \nbut also lead to unexpected actions or emotional responses."} - Content: Culture is a set of beliefs, values, and practices that shape our minds and behaviors. It provides a 
framework for understanding the world and interpreting our experiences. This shared framework 
enables individuals to communicate with each other and to cooperate with one another. Culture plays 
a significant role in shaping the way we think and perceive the world around us.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.
2025-05-20 22:30:13,571 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 3 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 2. Importance of understanding technological evolution
Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - Content: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - Content: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 22:30:13,575 - INFO - Segmented general content: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'General Information'} - Content: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.
2025-05-20 22:30:13,575 - INFO - Segmented subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 5 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Adaptive and Personalized interfaces', 'section': 'Adaptive interfaces', 'subsection': 'Personalized interfaces are interfaces that can be customized, allowing users some degree of \nflexibility in input/output modality, display and control. For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - Content: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This

operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - Content: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - Content: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.

Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

It stores memories, beliefs, and desires, even those we've \nforgotten, and influences us in ways we don't realize. This can be helpful, like automatic behaviors, \nbut also lead to unexpected actions or emotional responses."} - N\u1ed9i dung: Culture is a set of beliefs, values, and practices that shape our minds and behaviors. It provides a 
framework for understanding the world and interpreting our experiences. This shared framework 
enables individuals to communicate with each other and to cooperate with one another. Culture plays 
a significant role in shaping the way we think and perceive the world around us.

In essence, culture shapes us and is shaped by us, highlighting the \nimportance of cultural awareness in technology design.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Culture influences how people interact with technology, from interpreting icons to using interfaces 
and even adopting features like eye-tracking. HCI considers these "cultural affordances" and 
nonverbal cues to design user-friendly technology for diverse users.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.
2025-05-20 23:39:25,810 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Design Principles', 'section': 'Learnability', 'subsection': 'The familiarity principle is concerned with the ability of an interactive system to allow a user to map \nprior experiences, either real world or gained from interaction with other systems, onto the features \nof a new system.\nA recycle bin is a familiar item in the real world and recycle bin icon immediately suggests its \nfunction.\nThis type of familiarity is also referred to as the guessability of features in the system. Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.
2025-05-20 23:39:25,812 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 5 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Adaptive and Personalized interfaces', 'section': 'Adaptive interfaces', 'subsection': 'Personalized interfaces are interfaces that can be customized, allowing users some degree of \nflexibility in input/output modality, display and control. For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.
2025-05-20 23:43:29,043 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n n\u1ed9i dung chung: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Thï¿½ng tin chung'} - N\u1ed9i dung: 3. Robustness
The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

This can be helpful, like automatic behaviors, \nbut also lead to unexpected actions or emotional responses."} - N\u1ed9i dung: Culture is a set of beliefs, values, and practices that shape our minds and behaviors. It provides a 
framework for understanding the world and interpreting our experiences. This shared framework 
enables individuals to communicate with each other and to cooperate with one another. Culture plays 
a significant role in shaping the way we think and perceive the world around us.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.
2025-05-21 00:00:59,257 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Design Principles', 'section': 'Learnability', 'subsection': 'The familiarity principle is concerned with the ability of an interactive system to allow a user to map \nprior experiences, either real world or gained from interaction with other systems, onto the features \nof a new system.\nA recycle bin is a familiar item in the real world and recycle bin icon immediately suggests its \nfunction.\nThis type of familiarity is also referred to as the guessability of features in the system. Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.
2025-05-21 00:00:59,258 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 5 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Adaptive and Personalized interfaces', 'section': 'Adaptive interfaces', 'subsection': 'Personalized interfaces are interfaces that can be customized, allowing users some degree of \nflexibility in input/output modality, display and control. For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

This can be helpful, like automatic behaviors, \nbut also lead to unexpected actions or emotional responses."} - N\u1ed9i dung: Culture is a set of beliefs, values, and practices that shape our minds and behaviors. It provides a 
framework for understanding the world and interpreting our experiences. This shared framework 
enables individuals to communicate with each other and to cooperate with one another. Culture plays

and even adopting features like eye-tracking. HCI considers these "cultural affordances" and 
nonverbal cues to design user-friendly technology for diverse users.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction.

now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

It stores memories, beliefs, and desires, even those we've \nforgotten, and influences us in ways we don't realize. This can be helpful, like automatic behaviors, \nbut also lead to unexpected actions or emotional responses."} - N\u1ed9i dung: Culture is a set of beliefs, values, and practices that shape our minds and behaviors. It provides a 
framework for understanding the world and interpreting our experiences. This shared framework 
enables individuals to communicate with each other and to cooperate with one another. Culture plays 
a significant role in shaping the way we think and perceive the world around us.

Cultural backgrounds also affect attention, with Western cultures \nfocusing more on individual objects and Eastern cultures on relationships between them. These \ninternalized cultural frameworks, called mental models, guide our interactions with technology and \ninfluence our preferences. In essence, culture shapes us and is shaped by us, highlighting the \nimportance of cultural awareness in technology design.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Culture influences how people interact with technology, from interpreting icons to using interfaces 
and even adopting features like eye-tracking. HCI considers these "cultural affordances" and 
nonverbal cues to design user-friendly technology for diverse users.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.
2025-05-21 15:06:13,580 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Design Principles', 'section': 'Learnability', 'subsection': 'The familiarity principle is concerned with the ability of an interactive system to allow a user to map \nprior experiences, either real world or gained from interaction with other systems, onto the features \nof a new system.\nA recycle bin is a familiar item in the real world and recycle bin icon immediately suggests its \nfunction.\nThis type of familiarity is also referred to as the guessability of features in the system. Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.
2025-05-21 15:06:13,581 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 5 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Adaptive and Personalized interfaces', 'section': 'Adaptive interfaces', 'subsection': 'Personalized interfaces are interfaces that can be customized, allowing users some degree of \nflexibility in input/output modality, display and control. For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.
2025-05-21 15:19:24,227 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 5 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Adaptive and Personalized interfaces', 'section': 'Adaptive interfaces', 'subsection': 'Personalized interfaces are interfaces that can be customized, allowing users some degree of \nflexibility in input/output modality, display and control. For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

It stores memories, beliefs, and desires, even those we've \nforgotten, and influences us in ways we don't realize. This can be helpful, like automatic behaviors, \nbut also lead to unexpected actions or emotional responses."} - N\u1ed9i dung: Culture is a set of beliefs, values, and practices that shape our minds and behaviors. It provides a 
framework for understanding the world and interpreting our experiences. This shared framework 
enables individuals to communicate with each other and to cooperate with one another. Culture plays 
a significant role in shaping the way we think and perceive the world around us.

and even adopting features like eye-tracking. HCI considers these "cultural affordances" and 
nonverbal cues to design user-friendly technology for diverse users.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

a significant change to human civilization (Computer Hope, 2021). It refers to a profound and rapid 
transformation in the field of computing and information technology; encompasses significant 
advancements, innovations, and paradigm shifts that reshape the way computers are used, accessed, 
and integrated into various aspects of human life. Each computer revolution can be defined by the 
specific technology it introduced.
2025-05-21 15:23:47,744 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n n\u1ed9i dung chung: {'source_file': 'Topic 3 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Thï¿½ng tin chung'} - N\u1ed9i dung: 2. Importance of understanding technological evolution
Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

Your design should make simple,common tasks \nsimple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the userï¿½s own language, and providing good \nshortcuts that are meaning-fully related to longer procedure.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle requires a user's knowledge of interaction to be sufficient to 
determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.
2025-05-21 15:23:47,746 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n subsection: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Design Principles', 'section': 'Learnability', 'subsection': 'The familiarity principle is concerned with the ability of an interactive system to allow a user to map \nprior experiences, either real world or gained from interaction with other systems, onto the features \nof a new system.\nA recycle bin is a familiar item in the real world and recycle bin icon immediately suggests its \nfunction.\nThis type of familiarity is also referred to as the guessability of features in the system. Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.
2025-05-21 15:23:47,747 - INFO - \u0110ï¿½ phï¿½n \u0111o\u1ea1n n\u1ed9i dung chung: {'source_file': 'Topic 4 lecture HCI.pdf', 'topic': 'Thï¿½ng tin chung'} - N\u1ed9i dung: 2. Flexibility
Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

For example, a user may choose to increase \nthe size of the buttons on their browser, or change the look of the buttons altogether. Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction. As objects are increasingly differentiated based on design, they begin to take on their own \nidentity while reflecting the self-expression of their users. Consumers are increasingly more sensitive \nto branding, using design to differentiate themselves rather than being content with mass-produced \nfunctional products. Norman presents five different levels of customization, from no customization to \ncreating a whole new product, and suggests that users inherently want to customize. In any case, the \ntwo essential characteristics for successful personalization are ease of customization and ease of \ndistribution for sharing the customized interfaces.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: What makes personalization so interesting is the variety of product categories where consumers can 
now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

Power Distance
High power distance cultures tend to be more hierarchical, with a clear division of roles and 
responsibilities. This may affect user experience by influencing how people expect to interact with 
products and services, such as a preference for clear instructions or a desire for products that convey 
status or authority.
Individualism
In individualistic cultures, people may value personal autonomy and self-expression. This may 
manifest in user experience through a desire for products and services that allow for customization or 
personalization, or through an expectation of self-service or self-help options.
Masculinity / Femininity
Masculine cultures may place a greater value on achievement and assertiveness, while feminine 
cultures may prioritize cooperation and quality of life. This could influence user experience through 
design choices that reflect these values ï¿½ such as assertive, competitive design for masculine 
cultures or user-friendly, collaborative design for feminine cultures.
Uncertainty Avoidance
High uncertainty avoidance cultures may be more risk-averse and prefer products and services 
that minimize uncertainty and provide clear, detailed information. Low uncertainty avoidance 
cultures may be more tolerant of ambiguity and prefer products and services that allow for more 
open-ended exploration and experimentation.
Long-term orientation
Cultures with high long-term orientation may prefer products and services that encourage long-term 
thinking and planning, while cultures with low long-term orientation may place more emphasis on 
quick results and short-term performance. This could manifest in user experience through design 
choices that help users plan for the future or provide instant gratification.
Indulgence
Cultures that encourage indulgence may be more open to products and services that allow people to 
enjoy themselves and have fun, while cultures that suppress gratification of needs may prefer 
products and services that are more functional and practical. This could influence user experience 
through design choices such as the presence of fun, interactive features or a focus on practicality and 
efficiency.
Some other cultural models include Trompenaars and Hampden-Turnerï¿½s Seven Dimensions of 
Culture and Hallï¿½s Cultural Context Model.

When applying UX research methods for designing for cultural diversity in the real world, there are a 
number of potential issues that can arise. Some of these include:
\uf0b7 Recruiting participants: Recruiting a diverse group of participants for user research can 
be challenging, particularly if the target population is spread out geographically or if 
there are limited resources for recruiting participants from underrepresented groups.
\uf0b7 Language barriers: Conducting research in multiple languages can be challenging, as it 
may require additional resources, such as hiring research participants who are fluent in 
multiple languages or hiring a translator.
\uf0b7 Cultural bias: There is a risk of introducing bias in the research process when 
conducting research on different cultures, researchers need to be aware of their own 
cultural bias, blind spots and work towards minimizing them.
\uf0b7 Logistical challenges: Conducting cultural immersion or field research can be 
logistically challenging, as it may require travel to different locations, working with 
unfamiliar cultural norms and expectations, and obtaining the necessary permissions and 
consents.
\uf0b7 Analysis of results: Interpreting research findings can be challenging, particularly when 
dealing with cultures that have different norms, values, and ways of communicating. This 
can require additional expertise and cultural sensitivity when analyzing and interpreting 
research findings.
\uf0b7 Privacy and ethical concerns: When working with participants from different cultures, 
itï¿½s important to be sensitive to cultural norms and values related to privacy and consent. 
Itï¿½s also important to ensure that research participants are informed of their rights and 
that their information is kept confidential.
Itï¿½s important to note that these are not insurmountable issues and with proper planning, execution 
and ethical considerations, these methods can provide valuable insights on cultural diversity and help 
in creating inclusive and culturally sensitive products.

Revolution is a bigger force shaping our world now than it ever has been. Each era of the computing 
revolution has been defined by boundaries and constraints. We overcome the constraints and push 
past the boundaries and we then forget the boundaries existed as we accelerate breakthroughs on the 
path to ubiquity. The great author and futurist Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future contains a 
quote that we think embodies the spirit of exploration and discovery perfectly: "The only way of 
finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible". There are a number 
of big-picture developments that are going to change how we all approach technology in the future. 
The end of Moore's law, the explosion of data, the evolution of the edge among them. We've been 
able to take for granted that there's a PC on every desk and in every home for so long that we forget 
how impossible of a goal that must have seemed in the late 70s and early 80s. Bill Gates wrote his 
first commercial program on an Intel 8008 microprocessor. The most powerful GPU used for training 
AI models right now is billions of times more powerful than this device. If you combined every 8008 
ever made, that would still be several orders of magnitude less computing power than you carry 
around in your pocket in 2020. And that wasn't all.
The scarcity of compute at the beginning of the PC era was just one of many obstacles that had to be 
overcome before we could have personal computing so ubiquitous that we all have the luxury of 
taking it for granted. And here's the interesting thing: these impossible sounding constraints that Bill 
Gates and a bunch of other personal computing pioneers confronted in the early days of that era 
seemed more like challenges and opportunities to them than obstacles that should deter them. None 
of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they 
had a pretty good idea of the trends that would enable what they were attempting, as well as the 
technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the 
trends and constraints that are influencing one of the most significant developments in the history of 
computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI. 
Microsoft has been able to do some amazing things to drive this trend forward, but none of the major 
shifts in our computing revolution have happened just because of the efforts of one company. PCs 
became a phenomenon not because of the PC itself but because of the breadth of things people did 
with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the 
technology in the device but more about the breadth of applications on those devices and the people, 
content, and services those applications connect you to. At every one of these inflection points, the 
leaps forward we made were because of the contributions of developers. Any platform is only as 
good as the developers who use it, so for AI to achieve its full potential it must be a platform, and 
this platform will need to be powered and delivered at truly unprecedented scale and democratized so 
everyone can innovate and build on top of it.

Augmented Reality
AR overlays digital elements on the real world using sensors like GPS to track location and direction. 
Popularized by games like Pokemon Go, AR has a variety of applications. From virtually trying 
furniture before you buy to assisting brain surgery and analyzing football plays, AR is transforming 
many aspects of our lives.
Virtual Reality
Unlike AR, virtual reality is an immersive experience that isolates users from the real world, usually 
with the help of a headset and headphones to help. All five senses are also able to be incorporated. 
Instead of incorporating things into the real world, it replaces the real world and places users in 
completely new worlds. The technology allows users to use computer automation for a threedimensional experience. VR combines hardware, like headsets, controllers and treadmills and 
software, like game engines, content management and training simulators to create the full 
experience. The two main features of VR are immersion, which works by canceling out the physical 
world and fully placing users in the virtual world, and interaction which elevates the immersion 
experience by allowing users to control elements. VR in this industry is expected to grow by around 
$18 billion by 2028. The automotive industry also uses VR, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi and Tesla using the technology to build virtual showrooms. 
Internet of Things (IoT) advancements
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices or "things" that 
communicate and exchange data with each other through the internet. These devices can include 
everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect, transmit, and 
receive data.
The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to gather and share information in real-time, 
creating a more connected and intelligent environment. The data collected by IoT devices can be 
analyzed to provide insights, monitor and control various processes, and facilitate automation.
IoT is gradually playing important roles in our lives. Therefore, studying the trends and future of IoT 
will be very useful for the development process. The future of IoT is promising, with many exciting 
developments for businesses on the horizon. Paragraphs below are some of the trends and predictions 
for the future of IoT.
Blockchain technology and its role in the revolution
Blockchain acts as a secure and shared record-keeping system for transactions and assets. It can track 
anything valuable, tangible or intangible. This technology offers faster, more accurate information 
sharing for businesses by creating a transparent and immutable ledger. By allowing all authorized 
members to see the entire transaction history, blockchain builds trust, improves efficiency, and opens 
up new opportunities.

determine the outcome of present or future interaction with the system. One form of the predictability 
principle is concerned with a user's ability to envisage which operations can be performed next. This 
is often referred to as operation visibility, and is concerned with showing the availability of 
operations which can be performed next by the user. Based on this principle, if an operation can be 
performed then there should be a clear indication of this to the user.

Another \nexample of this is the similarity between the computer keyboard and that of a typewriter.\nThe appearance of an object provides familiarity with its behaviour. Effective use of appearance in \nan interactive system design can improve the familiarity of the system.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: This interactive design principle provides support for users to extend knowledge of specific 
interaction within, and across applications, to new, but similar situations. For example, 
cut/copy/paste operations within Microsoft Office applications use of same short-cut keys.
Similarly if a user knows how to draw a rectangle using a drawing package then the user can apply 
this knowledge to draw a circle using either the same package or other similar packages.
One of the purposes of standards, and programming style guides, is to increase generalisability across 
a variety of applications.

Flexibility in interactive design extends the way a user and the system exchange information. By 
applying flexibility principles to an interactive system design, designers aim to improve a system's 
usability.
Dialog initiative
When the system controls the dialog flow, the dialog is said to be system preemptive. Conversely, 
when the flow is controlled by the user, the dialog is said to be user preemptive. In general a user 
preemptive dialog is favoured although some situations require a system preemptive dialog. In reality 
some line between these two extremes is usually the most satisfactory solution.
Multi-threading
Within a user interface a thread can be considered a part of dialog that allowing a task to be 
performed. Multi-threading within a interface provides support for multiple tasks to be performed at 
one time.
Multi-threading can be described as concurrent or interleaved. An interleaved system permits work 
on a single task at a given time - a word processor allow multiple documents to be open, but only one 
can be worked on at any instant.
Task migratability
Task migratability means passing responsibility of execution of tasks between user and system. A 
computerised spell checker is a good example to this. It is a waste of time for a user to manually 
check a very long document and correct. A spell checking facility in a word processing application 
can check words against its own computerised dictionary. However, it is considered 'dangerous' to 
allow a spell-checker program to carry out this task without the user's assistance.
Substitutivity
Substitutivity offers a user alternative ways of specifying input or viewing output. Indeed the 
distinction between output and input can be blurred. For example, a drawing package may allow start 
and end co-ordinates of a line to be specified, conversely, the same system may allow the line to be 
drawn first, and the system indicates the end point co-ordinates.
Customisability
The user interface should be able to support individual preferences. For example standard control 
bars in MS Word can be amended as required.
Adaptivity can be automated but in order to be able to provide such user-centred system behaviours 
the system should be trained to distinguish an expert's behaviour from a novice user's behaviour. 
Repetitive tasks can be detected by observing a user's behaviour and macros can be automatically 
constructed.

The robustness of an interface design can be measured in terms of the following four principles. 
These principles aim to support users to achieve their goals.
Observability
Observability should provide users with an ability to evaluate the internal state from its 
representation. If a user cannot understand the internal state of the system, there is a high likelihood 
that the user's confidence will be very low, for example, if the system is performing a time 
consuming operation, the current status of the operation should be displayed - a web browser will 
indicate the on-going status of a page download.
There are several aspects to system observability. You should read up more on this topic in your 
textbook and/or on the Internet.
Recoverability
Users should be able to reach a desired goal after recognition of errors in previous interaction. Error 
recovery can be achieved in two ways, forward (negotiation) and backward (undo). Forward error 
recovery involves a user accepting the current state of the system and negotiating from the present 
state towards the required state. A backward error recovery mechanism within a system allows a user 
to undo the undesired outcome of the previous interaction by returning to a previous state.
In addition to providing the ability to recover forward or backward, the effort to achieve this should 
reflect the work being done - the commensurate effort.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness is usually measured in terms of the rate of communication between the system and a 
user. Response time, indicating change of states within the system, is important. Short duration or 
instantaneous response time is more desirable.
When an instantaneous response cannot be given by the system, the system should be able to indicate 
to the user that the system has received the request and in processing an appropriate action (see 
definition of observability).
As illustrated in the above picture, clicking the print icon on the Microsoft Word menu does not give 
feedback, e.g. especially novice users may end up pressing the print icon a number of times.

Instead of using \na ring tone on a mobile phone, a user can decide to receive vibrations alerts. Sensorial, aesthetic \nmappings can be changed at the userï¿½s whim. Parts of interfaces can be pared down or augmented.\nPersonalization serves to enhance self-expression and identity, rather than optimizing the interface \nfunction.

now participate in creating the look and feel of the end product. Potential buyers are given many 
levels of choices, so the product they take home is unique, designed around their personal preference. 
Instead of only choosing from among few possibilities, such as faceplates, buyers have the option of 
creating custom products that no other person may have an identical copy of. This flexibility in look 
and feel was a design approach that had been applied in fashion and accessories, and has finally 
migrated to other sectors.

At a time of Human Centered Design determining how we interact with multiple arenas in our lives, 
there is one significant interface that is stuck in the past of ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½. With an increasing 
amount of time being spent in our virtual lives vs. our real ones, there is a pertinent need to 
customize solutions that suit individual requirements, specifically on the digital front.
Consider the top few digital platforms worldwide - Instagram, Uber, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, 
AirBnB, Amazon, or literally any other app - What is being offered currently is significantly 
personalized content to suit our requirements. Be it AI Models that predict our taste in music and 
make recommendations, or data analytics which alters the price we pay for our transport. All that's 
served to us is backed by an in-depth understanding of who we are, and how we fall into a larger 
matrix. However, this highly pin-sharp data is fed to us in a rather standardized manner. Regardless 
of our differentiators like - body, shape, size, color, nationality, age, society, status, psyche etc., we 
are all provided ï¿½Personalized Dataï¿½ in a ï¿½Non-Personalizedï¿½ manner. This led to the thought of a 
'Personalized User Interface' which takes into account an 'Individual User Experience'.
Below are some thoughts from others on a Personalized User Interface -
Inclusivity - Most applications are currently being built for larger homogeneous cohorts. However, 
this can be significantly heterogenized through addressing the minorities -
1. Left / Right hand dominant users
The universal affordances that are currently offered in applications, are designed keeping in mind the 
right-hand dominant users - be it the 'Left to Right drag', 'Left to Right swipe', placement of labels or 
content icons. Take into consideration one of the most important elements of a consumer's decision 
making process - the ï¿½Call to Actionï¿½ button ï¿½ ï¿½Confirm the Order - Cancel/Yesï¿½ - The affirmative 
statement is always on the right and the refusal, always on the left. This is designed keeping in mind 
that for a right hander, the ï¿½Yesï¿½ button appears closer, and the decision making time (or fixation to 
an answer) can be reduced drastically.
Multiple studies also show that left-handers are significantly faster at processing information owing 
to stronger interactions across both sides of the brain. Their emotions and motivations are associated 
with activities on the right hemisphere and they are often regarded as more divergent and creative 
thinkers. Their reptilian brain (the section of the brain that caters to instinctual needs, rather than 
emotional or rational ones) has adapted itself to focus on novel survival mechanisms, which has 
helped them tackle multiple situations, differently. This insinuates the need for an experience 
designer to constantly cater to reformed ï¿½normalsï¿½. With 10 - 15% of the World Population being 
left-handed, it is a considerable market to address.
2. Motor Differences
Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an 
application. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to 
rapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. 
Though these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.
In most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is 
taken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal 
ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.

Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \ndetails and even frustration.'} - N\u1ed9i dung: Three photos of television remotes where the majority of buttons have been covered, 
leaving only holes for the channel, volume, and number buttons.
There are examples of Hickï¿½s Law in action everywhere, but weï¿½ll start with a common one: 
remote controls. As features available in TVs increased over the decades, so did the 
options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually we ended up with remotes so 
complex that using them required either muscle memory from repeated use or a significant 
amount of mental processing. This led to the phenomenon known as ï¿½grandparent-friendly 
remote.ï¿½

Another key principle is Millerï¿½s Law, which predicts that the average person can only keep 
7 (ï¿½ 2) items in their working memory. It originates from a paper published in 1956 by 
cognitive psychologist George Miller, who discussed the limits of short-term memory and 
memory span. Unfortunately there has been a lot of misinterpretation regarding this 
heuristic over the years, and itï¿½s led to the ï¿½magical number sevenï¿½ being used to justify 
unnecessary limitations (for example, limiting interface menus to no more than seven 
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
Two example numbers side by side, one a single unbroken string of ten digits, the other 
with parentheses around the first three digits, and a dash after the second three digits 
(resembling a phone number much like Jenny's from Tommy Tutone's classic song).
The simplest example of chunking can be found with how we format phone numbers. 
Without chunking, a phone number would be a long string of digits, which increases the 
difficulty to process and remember it. Alternatively, a phone number that has been 
formatted (chunked) becomes much easier to interpret and memorize. This is similar to how 
we perceive a ï¿½wall of textï¿½ in comparison to well-formatted content with appropriate 
headline treatments, line-length, and content length.

The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they 
based on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world. Things like 
form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile 
counterparts.
Key takeaways
Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that 
appears similar.
By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the 
user can focus on their task rather than learning new models.
Minimize discordance by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited 
time.

COURSE OVERVIEW
HCI is the study of how humans interact with computers. This course will introduce you to the

Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply

of those pioneers could have accurately predicted what personal computing would become, but they

technical challenges that they had to overcome. They invested into those trends and focused their 
ingenuity and creativity on overcoming those challenges. So we want to focus specifically on the

computing: the explosion of large-scale machine learning models and rapid advancements in AI.

Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
This directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it 
takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It 
was formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after 
examining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s 
reaction time to any given stimulus.
It turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . 
Fortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it

The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.

something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works.

Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.
Examples
This directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it 
takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It 
was formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after 
examining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s 
reaction time to any given stimulus.
It turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . 
Fortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it

The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.

with them. PCs are a platform for others to build on top of. The internet changed the world not 
because of TCP/IP and HTTP but because it was a platform for individuals and entrepreneurs and big 
businesses to create and innovate. Even what you do every day on your mobile device isn't about the

ï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the 
peripheries of what he/she is hitting.
3. JAKOBï¿½S LAW
The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Topic 6: Psychology in Design
Key principles
The intersection of psychology and design is extensive. Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles 
that occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s 
take a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and 
experiences we interact with everyday.
1. HICKï¿½S LAW
One of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present 
it in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity.
items).
Chunking
Millerï¿½s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered not on the number 
seven, but on the concept of ï¿½chunkingï¿½ and our ability to memorize information accordingly. 
When applied to design, chunking can be an incredibly valuable tool. Chunking describes 
the act of visually grouping related information into small, distinct units of information. When 
we chunk content in design, we are effectively making it easier to process and understand. 
Users can scan the content and quickly identify what they are interested in, which is aligned 
with how we tend to consume digital content.

Topic 6: Psychology in Design
Key principles
The intersection of psychology and design is extensive. Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles 
that occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s 
take a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and 
experiences we interact with everyday.
1. HICKï¿½S LAW
One of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present 
it in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. 
This directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it 
takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It 
was formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after 
examining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s 
reaction time to any given stimulus.
It turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . 
Fortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it 
means. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates
3. JAKOBï¿½S LAW
The last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User 
Experience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer 
your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put 
forth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an 
expectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. 
This principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid 
confusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.
Mental models
I know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would 
make for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is 
something incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another 
fundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.
A mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. 
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge
Whether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply 
that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge 
we already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.
Mental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model 
to improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from 
one product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system 
works. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is 
aligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental 
models and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use 
a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. 
The point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our 
users but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or 
experience we are designing.
Examples
Have you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans 
designing them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they

Thereï¿½s an endless list of principles \r\nthat occupy this space, but there are a few that Iï¿½ve found more ubiquitous than others. Letï¿½s \r\ntake a look at what these are and where they are effectively leveraged by products and \r\nexperiences we interact with everyday.\r\n1. HICKï¿½S LAW\r\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize information and present \r\nit in a way that it doesnï¿½t overwhelm usersï¿½after all, good communication strives for clarity. \r\nThis directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \r\ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \r\nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \r\nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \r\nreaction time to any given stimulus.\r\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \r\nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it', 0.13304241), ('Decreasing the motor load on an individual plays an integral role in their interaction with an \r\napplication. ï¿½Fittsï¿½ Lawï¿½, a predictive model of human movement, suggests that the time taken to \r\nrapidly move to an object is proportional to the distance to the object, and the size of the object itself. \r\nThough these learnings have been utilized in UI/UX Design, the offerings are still standardized.\r\nIn most cases, an average adult index finger width of 1.6 - 2 cm and thumb finger width of 2.5 cm, is \r\ntaken into consideration while developing mobile applications. This has been identified as an ideal \r\nï¿½sizeï¿½ at which a user can comfortably hit the target, while still being able to visibly see the \r\nperipheries of what he/she is hitting.', 0.030885685), ('3. JAKOBï¿½S LAW\r\nThe last principle weï¿½ll look at is Jakobï¿½s Law (short for Jakobï¿½s Law of Internet User \r\nExperience), which states that users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer \r\nyour site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. In 2000, it was put \r\nforth by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an \r\nexpectation of design patterns based on their cumulative experience from other websites. \r\nThis principle encourages designers to follow common design patterns in order to avoid \r\nconfusing users, which can result in higher cognitive load.\r\nMental models\r\nI know what youï¿½re thinking: if all websites followed the same design patterns, that would \r\nmake for quite the boring web. The answer is yes, that is probably true. But there is \r\nsomething incredibly valuable to be found in familiarity for users, which leads us to another \r\nfundamental concept in psychology that is valuable for designers: mental models.\r\nA mental model is what we think we know about a system, especially about how it works. \r\nWhether itï¿½s a website or a car, we form models of how a system works, and then we apply', 0.09679127), ('This directly relates to our first key principle: Hickï¿½s Law. Hickï¿½s Law predicts that the time it \r\ntakes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available. It \r\nwas formulated by psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman in 1952 after \r\nexamining the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individualï¿½s \r\nreaction time to any given stimulus.\r\nIt turns out there is an actual formula to represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 . \r\nFortunately, we donï¿½t need to understand the math behind this formula to grasp what it \r\nmeans. The concept is quite simple: the time it takes for users to respond directly correlates \r\nto the number and complexity of options available. It implies that complex interfaces result \r\nin longer processing time for users, which is important because itï¿½s related to a fundamental \r\ntheory in psychology known as cognitive load.\r\nCognitive load\r\nCognitive load refers to the mental processing power being used by our working memory. \r\nOur brains are similar to computer processors in that we have limited processing power: \r\nwhen the amount of information coming in exceeds the space available, cognitive load is \r\nincurred. Our performance suffers and tasks become more difficult, which results in missed \r\ndetails and even frustration.', 0.0014084355), ('that model to new situations where the system is similar. In other words, we use knowledge \r\nwe already have from past experiences when interacting with something new.\r\nMental models are valuable for designers, because we can match our userï¿½s mental model \r\nto improve their experience. Consequently, users can easily transfer their knowledge from \r\none product or experience to another without taking time to understand how the new system \r\nworks. Good user experiences are made possible when the designerï¿½s mental model is \r\naligned with the userï¿½s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our mental \r\nmodels and those of our users is one of our biggest challenges, and to achieve this we use \r\na variety of methods: user interviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. \r\nThe point of all this is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals and objectives of our \r\nusers but also their pre-existing mental models, and how that applies to the product or \r\nexperience we are designing.\r\nExamples\r\nHave you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do? Itï¿½s because the humans \r\ndesigning them had a mental model for what these elements should look like, which they \r\nbased on control panels they were already familiar with in the physical world.
